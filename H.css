<h2> Understand Botswana. </h2><hr><p2> The Tswana make up about 80% of the population of Botswana. In the 19th century, a common spelling and pronunciation of Batswana was Bechuana. Europeans therefore referred to the area inhabited by the Tswana as Bechuanaland. In the Tswana language, however, Botswana is the name for the country of the Tswana. </p2><br>
<p2> A Tswana womanâ€™s traditional dress, which has evolved over the centuries, indicates her position. It is usually a voluminous outfit of dull colour over which she wears a multi-coloured apron tied at the back. This is finished off with a head scarf. </p2><br>

<br><hr><p2> The best thing that I can do for people that can not be able is too watch the video of traditional people that are, pooor and live in shacks </p2><br>
